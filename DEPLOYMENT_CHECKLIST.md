- [ ] No hardcoded localhost URLs remain

### Backend Configuration
- [ ] Environment variables updated in `app/backend/.env`
- [ ] `DATABASE_URL` configured for production database
- [ ] `SECRET_KEY` and `JWT_SECRET_KEY` are secure
- [ ] `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` includes frontend production URL
- [ ] CORS configuration updated
- [ ] Database migrations ready
- [ ] File upload directory configured

### Security
- [ ] No sensitive data in code
- [ ] Environment variables not committed to Git
- [ ] Strong passwords for database
- [ ] HTTPS enabled for production
- [ ] Rate limiting configured appropriately

### Database

## üöÄ Deployment Steps

### 1. Backend Deployment
- [ ] Choose deployment platform (Render, Railway, Heroku)
- [ ] Connect GitHub repository
- [ ] Set build and start commands
- [ ] Add environment variables
- [ ] Deploy and test API endpoints
- [ ] Verify database connection
- [ ] Test file uploads

### 2. Frontend Deployment
- [ ] Choose deployment platform (Vercel, Netlify, Render)
- [ ] Connect GitHub repository
- [ ] Set build configuration
- [ ] Add environment variables
- [ ] Deploy and test application
- [ ] Verify API communication

### 3. Post-Deployment Testing
- [ ] Test user registration/login
- [ ] Test profile creation/editing
- [ ] Test post creation and viewing
- [ ] Test file uploads
- [ ] Test messaging functionality
- [ ] Test job board features
- [ ] Test responsive design
- [ ] Test cross-browser compatibility

## üîß Environment Variables Reference

### Frontend (.env)
```env
VITE_API_URL=https://your-backend-url.onrender.com
```

### Backend (.env)
```env
# Flask Configuration
SECRET_KEY=your-secure-secret-key-here
FLASK_ENV=production
FLASK_DEBUG=0

# Database Configuration
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://username:password@host:port/database

# JWT Configuration
JWT_SECRET_KEY=your-secure-jwt-secret-key-here

# CORS Configuration
ALLOWED_ORIGINS=https://your-frontend-url.vercel.app
```

## üêõ Common Issues & Solutions

### CORS Errors
- **Issue**: Frontend can't connect to backend
- **Solution**: Check `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` includes frontend URL

### Database Connection Errors
- **Issue**: Backend can't connect to database
- **Solution**: Verify `DATABASE_URL` format and credentials

### File Upload Issues
- **Issue**: Images/files not uploading
- **Solution**: Check file permissions and upload directory

### Environment Variables Not Loading
- **Issue**: App using default values instead of environment variables
- **Solution**: Verify variable names and restart application
